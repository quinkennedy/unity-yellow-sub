A Unity project which allows different types of clients 
(desktop, Vive, Hololens) to participate in a shared environment.
Each client type uses a unique avatar.

Currently the Host is automatically started on the Hololens, but the 
Network GUI is included for easily setting up a runtime network topology.

This was developed in Unity 5.5 on Windows 10.
